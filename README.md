In this thesis I integrate a preexisting object tracking library into the HoloLens 2 ecosystem and build a small application with a simple user interface.  This application enables the user to use object tracking to accurately build a simple brick tower by hand. To accomplish this, I make use of various Windows APIs and the new Research Mode for HoloLens 2 to provide the Object Tracker with the data streams it needs.
